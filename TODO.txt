- Clean up the docstring of pyvsf.vsf_props
- Improve the error messages in pyvsf.vsf_props
- Possibly add support to pyvsf.vsf_props for supporting vsf calculations where the velocities have fewer dimensions than the positions
- Possibly add support to pyvsf.vsf_props for supporting calculations where the distance has fewer than 3 dimensions.

- Update the c++ code to better support the selection of an accumulator
- Introduce a function to query the results computed by the different types of accumulators (this will be more necessary if we want to introduce additional accumulators)
