- Clean up the docstring of pyvsf.vsf_props
- Improve the error messages in pyvsf.vsf_props
- Possibly add support to pyvsf.vsf_props for supporting vsf calculations where the velocities have fewer dimensions than the positions
- Possibly add support to pyvsf.vsf_props for supporting calculations where the distance has fewer than 3 dimensions.

- Update the c++ code to better support the selection of an accumulator
- Introduce a function to query the results computed by the different types of accumulators (this will be more necessary if we want to introduce additional accumulators)

- Update the C++ code to support the use of multiple accumulators at the exact same time.
- Remove the code repetition between the accumulators and the python statistic
  kernels.
- It probably makes sense to refactor the python statistic kernels to actually be used as classes. When they were originally implemented, they were made into classes to effectively acts as collection of functions. But, it's become apparent that actually storing the configuration of a statistic in an object (rather than repeatedly passing the configuration to a class method), would be more optimal.
- Refactor small_dist_sf_props so that instead of passing in a list of statistic names and a list of kwargs, we pass in a pair of these.
- We probably want to alter the way that small_dist_sf_props refers to the structure statistics. In the future, we're going to add new statistics (that don't necessarily relate to the structure function) and it may cause confusion...
